# Docker

Docker is a platform that simplifies the development, delivery, and operation of applications by using containers. It allows you to bundle an application with everything it needs, such as libraries and dependencies, into a single container. This container can then be run on any system that supports Docker, without needing to change the host system.

## Key Concepts

- **Images**: These are like blueprints for containers, containing everything the container needs, including the operating system, libraries, and application code. You create images using a Dockerfile, and they can be shared or reused.
- **Containers**: These are live instances of images. They run in their own isolated environment, sharing the host’s core system, but remaining lightweight and portable.
- **Dockerfile**: A Dockerfile is a text file with a series of commands for creating an image.
- **Volumes**: Used for storing data that you need to keep, even if the container restarts or deleted.
- **Ports**: These allow containers to communicate with the host machine or other containers by opening specific channels.

## Basic Docker Commands

- `docker run`: Start a new container from an image.
- `docker ps`: View a list of containers that are currently running.
- `docker stop`: Stop a running container.
- `docker rm`: Delete a stopped container.
- `docker build`: Create a new image from a Dockerfile.
- `docker push`: Upload an image to a registry (like Docker Hub).
- `docker pull`: Download an image from a registry.
